# High-Priority Tools - Implementation Guide

## Overview

As part of enhancing the Grok Coding Agent, four high-priority tools have been added as first-level function calls:
- **git**: Direct git operations for version control
- **brew**: Homebrew package management for macOS
- **python/python3**: Python script execution
- **pip/pip3**: Python package management

These tools are now exposed in the same way as the existing tools (read_file, write_file, list_dir, bash), enabling the Grok AI to perform precise, structured operations without relying on generic bash invocations.

## Benefits

### 1. Git Tool
**Purpose**: Direct access to git operations for reliable GitHub integration.

**Benefits**:
- Structured inputs/outputs avoid shell parsing errors
- Cleaner separation of version control operations
- Better error handling for git-specific operations
- Enables features like branching, committing, and status checks with clear semantics

**Example Uses**:
- Check repository status
- View commit history
- Create branches
- Stage and commit changes
- Push/pull from remotes

### 2. Brew Tool
**Purpose**: Enable installing/managing macOS packages directly.

**Benefits**:
- Proactive OSX setup without manual bash commands
- Direct package management capabilities
- Better error reporting for installation issues
- Supports querying package information

**Example Uses**:
- Install new packages
- Upgrade existing packages
- List installed packages
- Get package information

### 3. Python Tool
**Purpose**: Facilitate running scripts or modules with clear args.

**Benefits**:
- Clear argument passing for Python scripts
- Better output capture for Python development
- Improved precision in testing and debugging
- Direct module execution support

**Example Uses**:
- Run Python scripts
- Execute modules with `-m`
- Run inline code with `-c`
- Check Python version

### 4. Pip Tool
**Purpose**: Support package management in virtual environments.

**Benefits**:
- Direct calls for dependency resolution
- Better CI/CD integration
- Reduces text-parsing hassles
- Clearer error messages for package operations

**Example Uses**:
- Install packages
- List installed packages
- Show package information
- Freeze requirements
- Uninstall packages

## Technical Implementation

### Tool Definitions
Each tool follows the OpenAI Function Calling specification:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "git",
    "description": "Execute git commands for version control operations...",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "args": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Git command arguments (e.g., 'status', 'log --oneline -10')"
        }
      },
      "required": ["args"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Implementation Details

All four tools are implemented as thin wrappers around `tool_bash_command()`:

```c
char* tool_git_command(const char *args) {
    // Validates args and builds "git <args>"
    // Delegates to tool_bash_command()
}
```

This approach:
- Maintains consistency with existing tools
- Ensures proper error handling
- Captures stdout, stderr, and exit codes
- Reuses the tested bash execution infrastructure

### Integration Points

1. **create_tools_array()**: Extended to include tools 5-8
2. **execute_tool()**: Updated dispatcher to handle git, brew, python, pip
3. **Forward declarations**: Added for the four new tool functions
4. **Tool implementations**: Four new functions wrapping bash execution

## Usage Examples

### Git Operations
```
User: "What's the status of this repository?"
Grok: [Calls git tool with args: "status --short"]
      Based on the git status, you have 2 modified files...
```

### Package Management (macOS)
```
User: "Install wget using brew"
Grok: [Calls brew tool with args: "install wget"]
      I've installed wget via Homebrew. The installation completed successfully...
```

### Python Development
```
User: "Run the test.py script"
Grok: [Calls python tool with args: "test.py"]
      The script executed successfully with the following output...
```

### Dependency Management
```
User: "List all installed Python packages"
Grok: [Calls pip tool with args: "list"]
      Here are the installed packages in your environment...
```

## Testing

A test script is provided: `test_new_tools.sh`

Run it to verify all tools are functioning:
```bash
cd src/c/grok-terminal
./test_new_tools.sh
```

The script tests:
- Git command execution
- Python availability
- Pip availability
- Brew availability (expected to fail on Linux)

## Compatibility Notes

- **git**: Available on most development systems
- **brew**: macOS-specific, will error gracefully on Linux
- **python**: Uses `python3` for maximum compatibility
- **pip**: Uses `pip3` for maximum compatibility

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add validation for common argument patterns
2. Implement tool-specific error handling
3. Add support for working directory context
4. Cache frequently used operations
5. Add timeout controls for long-running operations
